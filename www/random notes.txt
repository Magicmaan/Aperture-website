workflow idea:

php backend (obviously), functions contained in whatever
have middle man files that work through api
use jquery and AJAX to pull data from backend
populate frontend using jquery, css, html

todo: 
	rework literally every fucking function (not hard)
	implement api? key system by requesting address using one time api keys?
	
	i.e.
	
	localhost/request/getProfilepicture.php?key=12345
	
	on key usage, generate new key thats linked to php stuff
	
	
	key is found from php on page load under table tokens. It uses the current session in order to validate actions on both sides
	by user signing in and starting session, you validate that your session is you. Can then pull api / session
